LFI with a couple of input restrictions.

At it's simplest, &ls or &id will show that command execution is possible.

Using ls shows the files in the current dir, but spaces and slashes are blocked.

So this won't reveal the hidden administrator dir

Also the number of available chars is limited to 15

One way to overcome this is using find on it's own e.g. &find 

This will reveal the hidden dir

Another technique to overcome no spaces is brace expressions e.g.

&{ls,-a}
&{cat,*}

At this point it is possible to view the php page in browser, now we know the URL.
However, the page only has a message, identifying that the flag was commented out.

Now it is possible to get the source code for the php file and get the flag with grep and within the tight character limit:

&{grep,-r,.}




HINT:

What can you Find? Brace yourself for Expressions. Get ready for Grep!
